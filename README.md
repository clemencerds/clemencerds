# 👋 Hi, I’m Clémence

I’m a curious, adaptable, and passionate **front-end developer** with a background full of twists — from being a specialty coffee barista to running my own freelance business as a tour guide, creating websites, mastering SEO, and now: writing code that solves real problems.

## 🌱 My Journey Into Code

After years of wearing many hats professionally, I built my own website/blog for my freelance guiding work — learning the ropes of web development, SEO, and content management. That hands-on experience sparked something bigger: a desire to build tools from scratch, not just tweak existing ones.

I officially dove into **front-end development** and quickly fell in love with **React**. I’m now on a mission to keep learning, keep building, and contribute to projects that make life a little easier (and sometimes a little more fun).

## 🌍 What I'm Looking For

I'm currently looking for my **first front-end developer role** — ideally in a **caring, dynamic team** where I can keep learning and contribute everything I’ve gathered from my many professional lives (problem-solving, communication, adaptability... and React!).

## 🤝 Let’s Connect!

I’d love to connect with developers, teams, and fellow career switchers!
